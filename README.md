# System programming
## 3st semester
I was a small child, low-level typed language was too much for me. I mean code kinda smell for me now.

Also we were using Visual Studio and I take out only files that I coded for this repo, so It's may not work right away and I don't wanna test and fix all of this.

And we were told to use plain c most of the time with exception for `new` and something else, not sure why.
